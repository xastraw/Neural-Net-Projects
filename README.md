A set of neural net projects for our Machine Learning Final Project and our second Capstone Project

The Organ Net utilizes the OrganMinst3D dataset to train on, and we finished with an accuracy of 93.9% on the test dataset with a 0.18 loss accuracy. This  is the project we submitted for our Machine Learning class final project.

The face net is trained on a dataset of faces of varying ages and races. The net is then loaded into OpenCV and uses the webcamera to capture live video feed, of which the net will then detect any faces within the camera.
