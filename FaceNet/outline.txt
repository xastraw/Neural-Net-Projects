1. Obtain and process dataset of faces
2. Make sure dataset is in a format the network can train on
3. Build the network and start training on google Colab
4. Use OpenCV to use the camera
    4.1 Use OpenCV to load in the net weights and build a bounding box around the face it detects



Face Dataset:
    Might be easiest to use and has a wide variety of ages and races
