1. Obtain and process dataset of faces
    -beleive its done, at least the images are loaded into tensors
2. Make sure dataset is in a format the network can train on
3. Build the network and start training on google Colab
4. Use OpenCV to use the camera
    4.1 Use OpenCV to load in the net weights and build a bounding box around the face it detects
